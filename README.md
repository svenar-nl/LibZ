# LibZ

LibZ is a cross-platform 2d game library written in Java and it's currently available for Windows, Linux, Android* and Mac OS.
*Android version is different from the PC version.

### Getting started
* [Read the Wiki](https://github.com/winspeednl/LibZ/wiki)

### Downloads
Since we precompile using Ant you don't need to build yourself [Download pre compiled](https://github.com/winspeednl/LibZ/releases).

But if you want to build it yourself, go ahead!

If using Ant: Open a command-line screen and cd to the source directory and run 'ant' or 'ant main', after that you're done and you can find the jar inside the 'build' directory.
